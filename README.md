# README Generator Project

### Poject Creator
Cory Davis

## Description
This project provides a template to create professional standard README files VERY quickly. The user, simply, runs the application using the node index command and then follows the question prompts until the completion of the inquiry. Once finished, a new README file is generated and is ready to use.
