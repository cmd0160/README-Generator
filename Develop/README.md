  ### Project Creator
  Cory Davis
  ## Description
  This application displays a weather dashboard that provides you with accurate and real-time data regarding current and future weather conditions. There is a searchbar located on the left of the screen that allows you to search for a city that you wish to know the weather for. Those searched city are saved in local storage and displayed as a link on the screen so you can easily toggle between searched cities. At the top of the page you will find the current weather conditions and underneath you can find the five day forecast.
